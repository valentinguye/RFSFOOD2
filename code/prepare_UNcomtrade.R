### PACKAGES ###
# see this project's README for a better understanding of how packages are handled in this project. 

# These are the packages needed in this particular script. *** these are those that we now not install: "rlist","lwgeom","htmltools", "iterators", 
neededPackages <- c("fixest", # for some reason, it's necessary that fixest is loaded before other packages (I don"t know exactly which ones)
                    "data.table", "plyr", "tidyr", "dplyr",  "Hmisc", "sjmisc", "stringr",
                    "here", "foreign", "readxl", "writexl",
                    "raster", "rgdal", "sp", "sf", 
                    "knitr", "kableExtra",
                    "DataCombine", 
                    "boot",  "sandwich",# "fwildclusterboot",
                    "ggplot2", "dotwhisker", "leaflet", "htmltools", "viridis", "hrbrthemes")
# Install them in their project-specific versions
renv::restore(packages = neededPackages)

# Load them
lapply(neededPackages, library, character.only = TRUE)

# /!\/!\ IF renv::restore(neededPackages) FAILS TO INSTALL SOME PACKAGES /!\/!\ 

# For instance sf could cause trouble https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/921 
# or magick, as a dependency of raster and rgdal. 

# FOLLOW THESE STEPS:
# 1. Remove these package names from neededPackages above, and rerun renv::restore(packages = neededPackages)
# 2. Write them in troublePackages below, uncomment, and run the following code chunk: 

# # /!\ THIS BREAKS THE PROJECT REPRODUCIBILITY GUARANTY /!\
# troublePackages <- c() 
# # Attempt to load packages from user's default libraries.
# lapply(troublePackages, library, lib.loc = default_libraries, character.only = TRUE)

# 3. If the troubling packages could not be loaded ("there is no package called ...") 
#   you should try to install them, preferably in their versions stated in the renv.lock file. 
#   see in particular https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html 


# # # /!\ THIS BREAKS THE PROJECT REPRODUCIBILITY GUARANTY /!\
# troublePackages <- c("leaflet", "leaflet.providers", "png")
# # Attempt to load packages from user's default libraries.
# lapply(troublePackages, library, lib.loc = default_libraries, character.only = TRUE)
