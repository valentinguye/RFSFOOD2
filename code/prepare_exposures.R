### PACKAGES ###
# see this project's README for a better understanding of how packages are handled in this project. 

# These are the packages needed in this particular script. *** these are those that we now not install: "rlist","lwgeom","htmltools", "iterators", 
neededPackages <- c("fixest", # for some reason, it's necessary that fixest is loaded before other packages (I don"t know exactly which ones)

# Install them in their project-specific versions

# Load them
lapply(neededPackages, library, character.only = TRUE)

# /!\/!\ IF renv::restore(neededPackages) FAILS TO INSTALL SOME PACKAGES /!\/!\ 

# For instance sf could cause trouble https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/921 
# or magick, as a dependency of raster and rgdal. 

# FOLLOW THESE STEPS:
# 1. Remove these package names from neededPackages above, and rerun renv::restore(packages = neededPackages)
# 2. Write them in troublePackages below, uncomment, and run the following code chunk: 

# # /!\ THIS BREAKS THE PROJECT REPRODUCIBILITY GUARANTY /!\
# troublePackages <- c() 
# # Attempt to load packages from user's default libraries.
# lapply(troublePackages, library, lib.loc = default_libraries, character.only = TRUE)

# 3. If the troubling packages could not be loaded ("there is no package called ...") 
#   you should try to install them, preferably in their versions stated in the renv.lock file. 
#   see in particular https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html
